<img src="images/IMG_0168-1.JPG" height="250">
<p>My name is Ryan Van Earden I am 16 and live in Chino. I love to play and watch baseball all the time. I play baseball for my highschool Don Lugo High School in Chino. My favorite baseball team is the Angels and I enjoy going to watch them play. I hope to attend a 4 year college and play baseball aswell. </p>

<p>I would like to play baseball in college aswell. I would like to go out of state to college. I would prefer to go to Texas or Uath because I love the weather and the people. After college if baseball doesnt work out I would like to go into sports media. I would love to cover baseball for a big company like MLB network or Fox sports. I would also like to live in Texas when I am older aswell. This was a little about me and my hopes for the future.</p>
