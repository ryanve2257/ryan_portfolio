<p>This program was our final product in scratch. I coded this program with my peer Connor Burns. The name of the program is "Mini Game Maze". The goal of the game is to get your sprite to objects in a maze. Once you get the objects and touched them you would be sent to a mini game you must complete. Once you have made it through both mazes and completed the mini games you win the game.  I learned a lot about code throught this project like how to use algorithms to make the code as simple as possible. For example the movement of the sprites and the settings of the maze throught the program. You can play this program by clicking the picture above this text.</p>
